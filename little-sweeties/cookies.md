# Cookies

I made these for a gathering last weekend and they were SO good. Everyone begged for the recipe afterwards! Apparently, when you check in at a Hilton DoubleTree hotel \(I don't make a habit of this\), they give you a warm, fresh cookie and this is the recipe they use. [Test bookmark](http://...#abcd)

## Ingredients

Makes 26 cookies 226 grams butter, softened \(2 sticks\) 164 grams granulated sugar 150 grams packed light brown sugar 2 large eggs 6.25 ml vanilla extract 1.25 ml freshly squeezed lemon juice 280 grams flour 45 grams rolled oats 6 grams baking soda 6 grams salt Pinch cinnamon 465 grams good quality chocolate chips 220 grams chopped walnuts

## Method

Cream butter, sugar and brown sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer on medium speed for about 2 minutes.

Add eggs, vanilla and lemon juice, blending with mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, then medium speed for about 2 minutes, or until light and fluffy, scraping down bowl.

With mixer on low speed, add flour, oats, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, blending for about 45 seconds. Don’t overmix.

Remove bowl from mixer and stir in chocolate chips and walnuts. Portion dough with a scoop \(about 3 tablespoons\) onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper about 2 inches apart.

Refrigerate 2 to 4 hours.

Preheat oven to 150°C. Bake for 20 to 23 minutes, or until edges are golden brown and center is still soft.

Remove from oven and cool on baking sheet for about 1 hour.

Cook’s note: You can freeze the cookies, and there’s no need to thaw.

Preheat oven to 150°C and place frozen cookies on parchment paperlined baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake until edges are golden brown and center is still soft.
