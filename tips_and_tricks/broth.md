# Broth

The recipe is the same, cooking times can vary

Ingredients:

* Bones (chicken, fish, beef) 
/*/ a classic broth is made by roasting the bones first but if you save your chicken bones you can by-pass this step, I store the bones on a bag in the freezer and make broth when there are enough bones to fill the pot
* 2 stalks celery
* 1 large onion
* 1 large carrot peeled


\*\* The veggies should be cut up to match cooking times, small piece for fish broth as this takes 20 minutes to make, medium pieces (2cm long) for chicken broth as it takes 1 1/2 to 2 hours cooking and just halve to veggies for beef broth as this takes 10-12 hours to brew


pop the bones and the veggies in a pot, fill with **cold** water to cover the ingredients by 3cm and bring to a boil

once it comes to a boil, turn down heat to a gentle simmer for the required amount of time

drain the liquid and discard the bones and veggies, allow to cool and skim off fat before using or freeze in ice cubes so you can add to sauces when needed

**NOTE** Don't add salt and pepper to the liquid until you are serving either as soup or in a sauce, that way you can season the final dish and not the base!


\*\*\*\*

To quickly skim fat off the top, run a paper towel over the surface of  the bowl of broth, this quickly removes the little 'fat eyes' on the surface of the broth!

Freeze broth in silicone ice cube trays or muffin molds for quick access to add to sauces or gravies
