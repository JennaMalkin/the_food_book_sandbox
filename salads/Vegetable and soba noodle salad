#Vegetable and soba noodle salad with honey ginger cashews

##Ingredients
- 350g red cabbage
- 1 large or 2 small Lebanese cucumbers
- 1/2 a medium capsicum
- 100g snow peas
- 2 large spring onions
- 230g soba noodles
- 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 big handful of coriander leaves
- lime juice and sliced red chilli (optional)

###Dressing
- 2.5 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce
- 1.5 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
- 1.5 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic (from about 2 medium cloves)
- 1 teaspoon minced ginger

###Honey ginger cashews
- 3/4 cup (110g) dry roasted, unsalted cashews
- 2 teaspoons honey
- 1 teaspoon minced ginger

##Method
1. Put a large pot of water on to boil for the noodles, then slice the vegetables. To do this, finely shred the cabbage and place in a large mixing bowl. Then cut the cucumber, capsicum and snow peas into long, thin strips about half a centimetre wide, before adding to the bowl. Thinly slice the spring onion on a diagonal, then add that to the bowl, too.
2. Add the dressing ingredients to a jug or bowl, whisking to combine before setting aside.
3. Preheat the grill of your oven to medium heat and line a baking tray with baking paper. Add the cashews to a mixing bowl, along with the honey and ginger, stirring to coat the cashews evenly. Pour the cashews onto the baking paper, spreading them out so they're lying flat. Place under the grill (not too close to the heat) and cook for 1-3 minutes (removing halfway to toss), until the nuts are golden and the honey is bubbling. Watch them VERY closely, as they burn quickly. When done, remove from the grill and set aside to cool.
4. Cook your noodles according to packet instructions. Drain the noodles, rinse the pot, wipe it down and return the noodles to the pot along with 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil, tossing to coat (the oil will help stop the noodles from sticking together). Add the vegetables to the pot (removing any little person portions at this point), before pouring over the dressing and tossing to coat. Serve into bowls with the coriander, cashews (again, not for young children) and any lime juice or chilli as desired.
5. Enjoy!
